# Release report 2
This github repository shows preliminary results related to 18 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from NY and CT) sequenced in our laboratory at Yale.

## Data

The directory `data` contains genomes and their metadata. These genomes were sequenced between March 30th and April 2nd, 2020, by [Joseph Fauver](https://twitter.com/JosephFauver) and [Tara Alpert](https://twitter.com/tdalpert), using a MinION platform.

## Interpretation

Among the newly sequenced genomes, some were sampled from Connecticut residents, and are grouped together in our phylogenetic tree (see image). Based on the currently available data, this pattern suggests sustained transmissions have been take place in CT since at least early March. Europe is the most likely origin of this viral lineage.

Three of our newly released genomes were found to group inside a large Washington state clade, fact the adds extra evidence to sustained cost-to-cost transmission. Related genomes from this group were further spread, and now cause local outbreaks in Australia, Canada and Iceland.

The remaining genomes suggest multiple, separate introductions of viruses from European countries such as Belgium and the United Kingdom.

## Nextstrain

The directory `auspice` contains a json that was produced using the 'augur' from the nextstrain pipeline. This analysis was carried out by [Anderson Brito](). These results can be visualized using `auspice`, accessing the link below:
